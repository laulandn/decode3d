Classes for reading various 3d object formats 
===============

Work in progress...

Does not use GNU autotools for configure, instead goofy shell script...sorry!

Part of alib, can't be used standalone.

Uses nick3d for all definitions of 3d classes.

Most are unfinished, many are just placeholders.

Many mistakes and wrong things, do NOT trust to be useful for anything.
